///   - Traits
/// - Add: Resources added and initialized
///   - Components
///   - Traits

/// MODIFY
/// - Kubernetes Update
///   - Configuration
/// - PreModify (traits only): Before components are modified
///   - Traits
/// - Modify: Resources are modified

///   - Traits
///
/// DELETE
/// - Kubernetes Delete
///   - Configuration
/// - PreDelete:
///   - Traits
/// - Delete:
///   - Components
///   - Traits
///
/// Note that in deletion operations, Kubernetes will delete by owner reference before PreDelete. This means
/// that the components will likely be unavailable by the time PreDelete fires. It is only guaranteed to fire
