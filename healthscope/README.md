# Health Scope Controller

HealthScope controller is used to periodically check the health of all the components and update health scope custom resources.

## What will health scope controller do?

1. periodically check health status of components and update the HealthScope resource status.
2. serve as a http server, to output aggregated health information.

## How to install?

Use helm to install:

```shell script
helm install healthscope ./charts/healthscope
```

## How to use?

After HealthScope controller is installed by helm charts, setup an endpoint to it.
By default the charts will use ClusterPort, we can use port-forward to access HealthScope controller.

```shell script
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=healthscope,app.kubernetes.io/instance=health" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl port-forward $POD_NAME 8080:80
```

Then we'll be able to visit http://127.0.0.1:8080 to query status of health scope resource.

### Create health scope instance using application configuration

If you want to use health scope, you should create a health scope instance first, using Application Configuration.

A health scope instance is like below:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationConfiguration
metadata:
  name: my-health-scope
spec:
  scopes:
    - name: health
      type: core.oam.dev/v1alpha1.HealthScope
      properties:
        - name: probe-method
          value: "kube-get"
        - name: probe-endpoint
          value: ".status"
        - name: probe-timeout
          value: 30
        - name: probe-interval
          value: 60
        - name: failure-rate-threshold
          value: 0
        - name: healthy-rate-threshold
          value: 100.0
        - name: healthThresholdPercentage
          value: 100.0
```

You can also find this example here: [examples/health-scope-config.yaml](../examples/health-scope-config.yaml).

Apply this yaml:

```shell script
$ kubectl apply -f examples/health-scope-config.yaml
applicationconfiguration.core.oam.dev/my-health-scope created
```

Then you will find a health scope instance was created:

```shell script
$ kubectl get health
NAME              AGE
my-health-scope   31s
```

You could get more details from:

```shell script
$ kubectl get health my-health-scope -o yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha1
kind: HealthScope
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2019-10-20T09:42:30Z"
  generation: 3
  name: my-health-scope
  namespace: default
  ownerReferences:
  - apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha1
    blockOwnerDeletion: true
    controller: true
    kind: ApplicationConfiguration
    name: my-health-scope
    uid: 1c113398-16f2-4aa1-9dc0-cd05a686d17d
  resourceVersion: "2465881"
  selfLink: /apis/core.oam.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/healthscopes/my-health-scope
  uid: ba3fd01c-9ba6-4e1a-93c0-b96d102700af
spec:
  failureRateThreshold: 0
  healthyRateThreshold: 100
  probeEndpoint: .status
  probeInterval: 60
  probeMethod: kube-get
  probeTimeout: 30
status:
  lastAggregateTimestamp: "2019-10-20T09:43:31.541142387+00:00"
```

Then we could use this health scope in other Application Configuration.

### Add Component to health scope

We add application scopes to our [`first-app-config.yaml`](../examples/first-app-config.yaml).

```shell script
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationConfiguration
metadata:
  name: first-app
spec:
  components:
    - componentName: helloworld-python-v1
      instanceName: first-app-helloworld-python-v1
      parameterValues:
        - name: target
          value: Rudr
        - name: port
          value: "9999"
      traits:
        - name: ingress
          parameterValues:
            - name: hostname
              value: example.com
            - name: path
              value: /
            - name: service_port
              value: 9999
+     applicationScopes:
+       - my-health-scope
```

Apply the config file:

```shell script
$ kubectl apply -f examples/first-app-config.yaml
applicationconfiguration.core.oam.dev/first-app created
```

You could check the scope like below:

```shell script
$ kubectl get health -o yaml my-health-scope
  apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha1
  kind: HealthScope
  metadata:
    creationTimestamp: "2019-10-20T09:42:30Z"
    generation: 10
    name: my-health-scope
    namespace: default
    ownerReferences:
    - apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha1
      blockOwnerDeletion: true
      controller: true
      kind: ApplicationConfiguration
      name: my-health-scope
      uid: 1c113398-16f2-4aa1-9dc0-cd05a686d17d
    resourceVersion: "2466413"
    selfLink: /apis/core.oam.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/healthscopes/my-health-scope
    uid: ba3fd01c-9ba6-4e1a-93c0-b96d102700af
  spec:
    failureRateThreshold: 0
    healthyRateThreshold: 100
    probeEndpoint: .status
    probeInterval: 60
    probeMethod: kube-get
    probeTimeout: 30
  status:
    components:
    - instanceName: first-app-helloworld-python-v1
      componentName: helloworld-python-v1
      status: healthy
    lastAggregateTimestamp: "2019-10-20T09:49:22.820141484+00:00"
```

The status indicates that we have successfully added our component to this scope.

### Visit health scope instance to check health

Do you still remember our port mapping in the first step? Visit that url with our health scope instance:
```
$ curl 127.0.0.1:8080/my-health-scope
healthy
```

Then you will find it's healthy nowã€‚
