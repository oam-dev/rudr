# Workloads

The *workload type* (`workloadType`) is a field in the [component schematic](./component-schematic.md) used by the developer to direct the runtime to properly execute the given component. Workload types are container-based and distinguished by the following characteristics:

 - Whether they have a ***service endpoint***: an automatically assigned virtual IP address and DNS name addressable within the network scope to which the component belongs.
 - Whether they are ***replicable***: An application operator can increase or decrease the number of component replicas by applying and configuring traits when available.
 - Whether they are ***daemonized***: Rudr will attempt to restart replicas that exit, regardless of error code.

Rudr supports all of the Open Application Model [Core Workload Types](https://github.com/oam-dev/spec/blob/master/3.component_model.md#core-workload-types):

|Name|Type|Service endpoint|Replicable|Daemonized|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|[Server](#server)|core.oam.dev/v1alpha1.Server|Yes|Yes|Yes
|[Singleton Server](#singleton-server)|core.oam.dev/v1alpha1.SingletonServer|Yes|No|Yes
|[Task](#task)|core.oam.dev/v1alpha1.Task|No|Yes|No
|[Singleton Task](#singleton-task)|core.oam.dev/v1alpha1.SingletonTask|No|No|No
|[Worker](#worker)|core.oam.dev/v1alpha1.Worker|No|Yes|Yes
|[Singleton Worker](#singleton-worker)|core.oam.dev/v1alpha1.SingletonWorker|No|No|Yes

Workload types are assigned to components as part of the [developer](https://github.com/oam-dev/spec/blob/master/2.overview_and_terminology.md#roles-and-responsibilities) role. They indicate to the [application operator](https://github.com/oam-dev/spec/blob/master/2.overview_and_terminology.md#roles-and-responsibilities) what trait(s) in the [application configuration](./application-configuration.md) that the component might require.

Workloads are named using the `GROUP/VERSION.KIND` Kubernetes convention, where `GROUP` is a uniquely named service collection, `VERSION` is an API version, and `KIND` is a group-unique name of a service. For example:

<pre>
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ComponentSchematic
metadata:
  name: alpine-forever-v1
spec:
  <b style="color:blue;">workloadType:</b> core.oam.dev/v1alpha1.SingletonServer
  parameters:
    - name: message
      type: string
      required: false
    - name: unused_integer
      type: number
      required: false
      default: 5678
  containers:
    - name: runner
      image: technosophos/alpine-forever:latest
      env:
        - name: FOO
          value: bar
          fromParam: message
        - name: UNUSED
          value: "1234"
          fromParam: unused_integer
</pre>

It's important to understand that workload types don't have associated CRDsâ€”they are simply just a field within a component. As such, Rudr users can't define custom workload types; they are limited to the workload types predefined by the platform runtime.

For more on specific workload types, refer to the sections below.

## Server

A Server is used for a long-running, scalable workload with a network endpoint and  stable name to receive network traffic for the component as a whole. Common use cases include web applications and services that expose APIs.

The Server workload in Rudr is implemented by a [Kubernetes Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) binding with a [Kubernetes Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).

| :-- | :--| :-- | :-- |

### Supported traits

- [Autoscaler](./traits.md#autoscaler)
- [Manual Scaler](./traits.md#manual-scaler)
- [Ingress](./traits.md#ingress)
- [Volume Mounter](./traits.md#volume-mounter)

## Singleton Server

A Singleton Server is a special case of the Server workload type that is limited to at most one replica of the container being run at a time.

> **IMPORTANT**: Operators should not attempt to modify the `replicaCount` on a `Deployment` created by a `SingletonServer`.

The Singleton Server in Rudr is implemented by a [Kubernetes Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) binding with a [Kubernetes Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/).

### Supported traits

- [Ingress](./traits.md#ingress)
- [Volume Mounter](./traits.md#volume-mounter)

## Task

A Task is used to run code or a script to completion. Its commonly used to run cron jobs or one-time highly parallelizable tasks that exit and free up resources upon completion.

The Task in Rudr is implemented by a [Kubernetes Job](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/).

## Singleton Task

A Singleton Task is a special case of the task workload type that is limited to at most one replica of the container being run at a time.

It is implemented by a [Kubernetes Job](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/).

### Supported traits

## Worker

A Worker is used for long-running, scalable workloads that do not have a service endpoint for network requests, aside from optional liveliness and readiness probe endpoints on individual replicas. Workers are typically used to pull from queues or provide other offline processing.
