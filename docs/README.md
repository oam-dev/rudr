# Rudr documentation

*Rudr* is the Kubernetes reference implementation of the [Open Application Model](https://github.com/oam-dev/spec) (OAM) specification, a team-centric standard for building cloud-native apps, where:

To get started, check out the *Install Rudr* guide and the *Tutorial*. The *Concepts* guides will walk you through all the available options Rudr provides to run and manage applications, and the *How-Tos* cover more advanced scenarios.

## [Install Rudr](./setup/install.md)
Install the Rudr runtime and its dependencies.

## [Tutorial](./tutorials/deploy_and_update.md)
Learn how to deploy, inspect, and update a Rudr application.

## Concepts
Learn more about the main application model constructs: components (and their workloads), traits, and application configurations.

### [Component Schematic](./concepts/component-schematic.md)

<img align="right" alt="The component schematic defines the parameters, workload type, and containers of a unit of code." src="./media/component.png" />

Learn how a <b>developer</b> can define the functional units that may be instantiated as part of a larger distributed application and their respective [workloads](./concepts/workloads.md).

<br />

### [Application Configuration](./concepts/application-configuration.md)

<img align="right" alt="The application configuration defines the parameters, components, and other runtime properties of the overall application." src="./media/application.png" />

Learn how an <b>application operator</b> can define how an overall application will be instantiated and configured.

<br />

### [Traits](./concepts/traits.md)

<img align="right" alt="Traits represent add-on runtime functionality assigned to component workloads from within the application configuration." src="./media/traits.png" />

Learn how an <b>application operator</b> can attach operational features to component workloads of an application.

<br />
<br />
<br />

### [Scopes](./concepts/scopes.md)

<img align="right" alt="Scopes are used to logically group components within an application." src="./media/scopes.png" />

Learn how an <b>application operator</b> can define application boundaries by grouping components with common properties and dependencies.

## How-To's
